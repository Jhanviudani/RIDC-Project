Below is a snapshot of what a Weekly Feedback Session looks like. Feedback Session Format Feedback Sessions are designed to provide Founders with advice and personalized feedback from experienced mentors and investors throughout each step in their business-building process. 1 5 Minutes Welcome & Mentor Intros Each session typically begins with a brief introduction of the mentors and any house keeping announcements for the cohort. For smaller cohorts, Local Leaders invite the Presidents to provide a progress report from their Working Group. 2 40 Minutes Founder Hotseat Pitches and Feedback Every session starts with multiple "Founder Hotseats", where Founders pitch their startup and the progress made in the program to a panel of Mentors . Pitches are rated on a scale from 1 to 5 based on criteria such as the clarity of the presentation, the quality of the idea, and other key factors. You can learn about the Founder Institute's "no threes allowed" policy ( here ). Based on the pitch, Mentors give the Founders critical advice on how to improve the business further. 3 30 Minutes Mentor Talks The session continues with Mentor talks and/or presentations, where 1-2 of the Mentors share their insights on the session's topic. The focus is on providing Founders with practical, actionable advice to address the challenges they face, drawing from the Mentors' own entrepreneurial experiences and real-world strategies. Topics that are covered during the weekly sessions include customer development strategies, business model comparison, co-founder relationships and equity structure, pitching and fundraising from angel investors and VCs, building an MVP, prioritizing features and building a roadmap, and more. 4 15 Minutes Q&A with All Mentors The next portion of the session is a Q&A discussion in which Founders will have the opportunity to ask the Mentors questions about the challenges they are facing. Here, Founders can hear personal stories from the Mentors themselves, get additional feedback on their progress, how to solve their problems, and more. 5 30 Minutes Strategy Presentations After the Q&A, Founders are split into 3 breakout rooms based on their track (Validate, Launch, Traction). In each breakout room, Founders present their "Strategy Presentations" for feedback from a Mentor who is assigned to that room. The Strategy Presentation focuses on a specific component of their business, such as the Buyer Persona, the Revenue Model, the Go-To-Market Startegy and more, allowing Founders to dive deeper into a particular aspect of their startup and receive in-depth feedback from the Mentors. These presentations are prepared by the Founders each week as part of their weekly Sprint, where they learn the fundamentals of a topic and develop these presentation for review. If any group finishes before the others, they can join the main room for additional open Q&A with the mentors. 6 30 Minutes Networking Networking takes place after the formal session ends, giving Founders the chance to continue building connections within the cohort. During this time, Founders are encouraged to engage with one another, exchange ideas, discuss challenges, and collaborate on potential opportunities. It's a valuable opportunity for Founders to find support among their peers and expand their network in a more informal setting. Post-Session The Feedback Sessions are just the beginning. Growth Sprints After each session, Founders have until the following session to complete a challenging Growth Sprint, designed to take approximately 10-30 hours in total. In the first few weeks, the Sprints start at 10-15 hours, with the workload gradually increasing to help Founders build momentum. Following FI's structured company-building methodology, each Sprint contains actionable deliverables aimed at helping Founders build the beginnings of their Team, Product and Traction and become investment-ready. Example Deliverable 6: (Three Customer Problems) Brainstorm and formulate at least three hypotheses of Customer Problems related to your startup idea. Work on your market research and think of unique problems that you believe exist on the market and potential customers are willing to pay to solve. Founders often need help to define a clear problem they are solving. Otherwise, the problem is too vague or big. To avoid that, think about who would be the customer (the person who buys the solution) or the consumer (the person who uses the solution) for each problem. Follow the steps below: Write down as many Customer Problems as you can think of within your Problem Space. Define a Buyer Persona for each Customer Problem and document it next to the corresponding problem. Narrow your list to three Customer Problems that have high potential and list their related Buyer Personas. For each of the three problems, write a one-sentence pitch that is specific and clear and you can use to validate the problem with potential customers. Growth Sprints & Resources Growth Sprints & Resources Growth Sprints & Resources Epic Sprints If a Founder falls behind in the program, receives notably poor feedback from the Mentors, or needs to drastically improve an aspect of their business, they may be given an Epic Sprint. Epic Sprints, which are tailored to each company, are designed to address areas of improvement and any poor feedback a Founder has received in order to help them correct the issues in their business. For example, below is an example Epic Sprint that was given to a Founder who received poor feedback related to their product definition and customer development progress: Example EPIC SPRINT - First, study the best practices to complete market research and surveys for your target market, and summarize your conclusions in a one-page document. Second, produce a professional fifteen-question survey that will help you to understand the needs and issues of your target market. Third, secure 1,000 responses to the survey from your target market via online advertising, social media, and more. Finally, produce a 10+ page PDF report that analyzes the results and outlines conclusions that will influence your product development. Customized Sprints Customized Sprints Office Hours Office Hours provide Founders with the opportunity to speak with the Local Leaders and Mentors for 20 to 30 minutes, to discuss challenges they are facing with their business, and address any issues with their progress. To make these meetings efficient, Founders must prepare (1) an agenda of the topics that they would like to cover, and (2) an updated blurb of their business. Startup Blurb: HR Genius is developing a SaaS solution to help HR managers at mid-to-large tech companies efficiently hire top candidates. Our AI-powered platform standardizes resumes and analyzes candidates across 10+ social media and coding communities. So far, we've: Interviewed 15 HR managers, 10 hiring managers, and 7 tech recruiters at Cisco, Salesforce, and HubSpot to validate the problem. Secured a soft commitment for a pilot with HubSpot. Maria Hill – Founder & CEO, HR Genius Office Hours tools Office Hours tools Working Groups Throughout the program, each Founder is placed into rotating Working Groups with their peers, in order to build camaraderie and allow Founders to help each other on their Growth Sprints. Working Groups are organized by company stage and are expected to meet at least twice per week in between sessions. Working Groups also have self-selected "Presidents", who take a leadership role and handle additional responsibilities for the group. Example From Week 1 to 5, Founders are split into groups of 4-6 people and are assigned to their first Working Group. This is their support group until the Mentor Idea Review session which is the first milestone of the program. Roughly 15% of the Founders drop out of the program after the Mentor Idea Review and the Working Groups are reschuffled again. Helpful working groups Helpful working groups Systematic Feedback At Founder Institute, we emphasize the importance of systematic feedback throughout every stage of the program. Each weekly session is designed to provide founders with actionable insights, and different view points from a group of mentors and experts. Founders are consistently encouraged to engage with potential customers, seek feedback from mentors, and connect with industry experts, gathering a variety of perspectives. This feedback loop is built into every deliverable and company-building task, pushing founders to continuously iterate on their business, refine their pitch and progress further. By collecting and integrating diverse viewpoints early on, founders can quickly adjust their strategies and accelerate their path to success.

Review Sessions There are two major Review Sessions during FI Core, which serve as major checkpoints in the program. Mentor Idea Review : The first milestone of the program where all Founders deliver 3-minute pitches of their business in front of a jury of Mentors for ratings and feedback. Investor Progress Review : The second milestone session, where all Founders deliver 5-minute pitches on their business and traction to a panel of Investors and Mentors. Bonus sessions Many FI chapters also create additional sessions to address regional and location-specific topics or industry specific topics. For example, it is typical for many European chapters to host additional Legal Sessions to ease the burden of incorporating a company, and many Asian chapters also host special sessions on Doing Business in China. Some chapter organize industry-specific sessions to cover hot trends such as AI, Sustainability, Blockchain and more. Invite-Only Events Founder Institute regularly organizes invite-only events exclusively for its network of founders, mentors, and investors. As part of the FI core program, founders gain access to some of these high-profile events, where they can network with top-tier VCs from Silicon Valley, hear from influential thought leaders, and learn directly from successful, well-known founders. These events provide valuable opportunities for connection, insight, and growth within the FI community.
