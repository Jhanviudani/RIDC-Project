No other place in the city has the resources and the support that Community Forge and the staff offer!â Canaan Blackwell Loco Lyfe âI really enjoy using the phase focus studio! It has helped us grow our brand Loco Lyfe. The team at CF is amazing and always willing to help!â Josh C. Hub Member Community Forge has become a place where I can reliably focus on my remote job, as well as meet creative people doing exciting work. Itâs a supportive, relaxed, calm, and well-furnished environment. I highly recommend checking it out! Donald Robinson GH Performance Itâs been great watching The Forge grow and being able to see the organization create more structures to help. Itâs gone from a small organization and ballooned to serve a lot more people by creating programs that are timelyâfor example, Bloom 2.0 getting businesses back on their feet during the re-opening after the peak of the pandemic.
